## 🚨 Problem Statement

Modern applications depend on many external services such as cloud servers, OTP systems, payment gateways, APIs, and hardware suppliers.

If even **one** of these services fails, the entire application can stop working — even when the main system itself is healthy.

Currently, companies have **no simple way** to predict which service is becoming risky *before* a failure happens.  
Most issues are discovered only **after users are affected**, leading to outages, customer frustration, and business loss.

This project aims to **predict risky services early** and **explain the risk in simple, human-readable language**.

## 🌍 Why This Problem Matters

Many real-world outages happen because a single external service fails.

- ☁️ Cloud service outages  
- 🌐 API / CDN failures  
- 💳 Payment system disruptions  
- 📱 Platform outages  
- 🛰️ Network failures  

Our project focuses on predicting such risks before they impact users.
