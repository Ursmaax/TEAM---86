## 🚀 The Mission

Global supply chains are complex, opaque, and vulnerable to chaos—from the Red Sea crisis to port congestion. Traditional tools only tell you *after* a delay happens.

**RiskWise is different.** It is a **Planetary-Scale Intelligence Platform** that acts as your 24/7 Supply Chain Command Center. By synthesizing real-time geopolitical signals, trade data, and logistics vectors, it gives unmatched foresight into the future of your shipments.

## ⚡ Key Features

*   **🤖 Multi-Agent Swarm Architecture**  
    A coordinated team of specialized AI agents (Political Strategist, Logistics Coordinator, Trade Analyst) working in parallel to dissect risks.
*   **🧠 Hyper-Fast Inference (LPU)**  
    Powered by **Groq**, delivering sub-second analysis for real-time decision making.
*   **🌐 Geospatial Surveillance**  
    Interactive 3D visualization of shipping routes with color-coded risk vectors.
*   **📊 "Fortune 500" Command Center UI**  
    A dark-mode, glassmorphism interface designed for professional logistics operators to reduce cognitive load.
*   **📄 Automated Executive Reporting**  
    Generates PDF-ready strategic briefs for C-Suite decision makers instantly.

## 🛠️ How It Works (The Core Loop)

RiskWise isn't just a chatbot. It is a **Deterministic Orchestration Engine**.

1.  **Input Vector**: User defines Product, Origin, Destination, and Mode (e.g., "Semiconductors, Taiwan -> Germany, Air").
2.  **Agent Dispatch**: The `RiskWiseOrchestrator` spins up three dedicated experts:
    *   `PoliticalAgent`: Scans for regional instability, sanctions, and conflict.
    *   `LogisticsAgent`: Evaluates port congestion, weather patterns, and route safety.
    *   `TradeAgent`: Checks for tariffs, compliance roadblocks, and regulatory shifts.
3.  **Synthesis**: The `ReportingAgent` aggregates these conflicting signals into a single "Risk Score" (0/20) and a cohesive narrative.
4.  **Visualization**: Results are rendered on a 3D Pydeck globe with live metrics.
