## 🚨 Problem Statement

**Global supply chains are breaking, and companies are flying blind.**

Today, logistics teams react to problems *after* they happen.
*   A ship gets stuck in port? **They find out 3 days later.**
*   A new tariff is announced? **They miss the news.**
*   A storm blocks a route? **Their goods are already stuck.**

This delay costs companies millions of dollars and causes major shortages (like chips or medicines) around the world. There is no simple tool that predicts these risks *before* they become disasters.

## 💡 Our Solution: RiskWise AI

**RiskWise is an intelligent "Command Center" for supply chains.**
It uses AI agents to watch everything—politics, weather, trade laws, and shipping routes—24/7.

Instead of just showing you a map, it acts like a team of expert analysts:
1.  **Predicts Delays** before they happen.
2.  **Reads News & Laws** instantly to find risks.
3.  **Scores Every Shipment** so you know exactly which ones are safe.

## 🛠️ How It Works

We built a **Multi-Agent System** where different AIs work together:

1.  **You Enter a Route**: e.g., "Semiconductors from Taiwan to Germany".
2.  **The Agents Wake Up**:
    *   🏛️ **Political Agent**: Checks for conflicts or sanctions.
    *   🚢 **Logistics Agent**: Checks for port jams or bad weather.
    *   📜 **Trade Agent**: Checks for new taxes or rules.
3.  **The System Thinks**: It combines all this data into one simple **Risk Score (0-20)**.
4.  **You Get Answers**: A full report explaining exactly *what* might go wrong and *why*.

## 💻 Tech Stack

*   **Brain**: Groq LPU (Ultra-fast AI inference)
*   **Logic**: Python & Multi-Agent Orchestrator
*   **Interface**: Streamlit (Custom "Dark Mode" Design)
*   **Map**: Pydeck (3D Geospatial Visualization)
