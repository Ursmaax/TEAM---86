## 🚨 Problem Statement

Global supply chains are very complex.

Companies depend on many things such as suppliers, shipping routes, ports, and government rules.  
Because of this, problems can happen at any time.

Common problems include:
- Shipping delays
- Port congestion
- Political conflicts
- Tariff and trade rule changes
- Logistics failures

Most companies know about these problems **only after the delay happens**.  
By that time, projects are already affected and money is lost.

There is no simple system that can watch these risks continuously and warn teams early.

The goal of **RiskWise** is to use AI to detect supply chain risks early and explain them in simple language, so teams can take action before delays happen.
